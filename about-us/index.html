        <h4>Our Vision</h4>
        <p>Our vision is to nurture the small seeds of hope within each youth with whom we work. Many of
          them have the kind of hope that is only a vague feeling of wanting to live a different and better
          life. Others have exciting, detailed dreams which they hope to realize, but do not have the
          necessary tools and resources.</p>
        <p>By linking inner city youth with positive role models, educating them on the available resources
          and opportunities, and providing access to funding for college scholarships, we believe that these
          seeds of hope can grow, flourish and lead to a renewed life, free of many of the burdens they
          carry today.</p>

        <h4>Our Mission</h4>
        <p>Our purpose is to motivate and support inner city
          youth to prepare for and obtain higher education. Our programs connect youth to mentors who
          serve as role models for careers, family life, and community service. Our mentorship programs
          focus on improving academic functioning, experiencing the value of work, expanding awareness
          and appreciation of self, others, and the environment beyond their home and neighborhood
          situations. Those who successfully complete our mentorship programs are eligible for college
          scholarships at participating universities.
